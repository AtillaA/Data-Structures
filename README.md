Exercise definitions in each sub-repository are provided by Sabanci University as part of the coursework for _Data Structures_ (Fall 2018) during my bachelor's degree. Provided codes are my own work, implemented to fulfill the requirements of the assignments. Methods were originally tested on Visual Studio 2017. Refer to the appropriate sources in case of internal library failures.
